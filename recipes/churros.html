            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>These churros are crispy on the outside, yet wonderfully tender on the inside. This restaurant-worthy churro recipe will quickly become a staple in your dessert rotation.</p>
            <p>A churro is a cinnamon- and sugar-topped fried pastry dough stick with Spanish and Portuguese origins. Churros are similar to doughnuts, but they have ridges because they are piped out of a pastry bag. Because they are fried instead of baked, churros have a fluffy and tender interior with a satisfyingly crispy exterior.</p>

            <ol>

                <li>Transfer the dough to a pastry bag and pipe into strips.</li>
                <li>Fry the strips in hot oil until they're golden.</li>
                <li>Drain the churros, then roll in cinnamon-sugar.</li>

            <p><strong>TIP:</strong>Keep the oil temperature consistently between 350 and 375 degrees F (175 and 190 degrees C) as you fry. If it gets too hot, turn off the heat and let the temperature drop down to that range.</p>
